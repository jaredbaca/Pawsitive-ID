# Pawsitive-ID
Dog Breed Identification
#### Authors: Jared Baca, Stephen Boorman, Sri Nikhil Reddy Gudibandi, Sridivya Raparla, Rubeena Riyas, Shiyu Wang

## Overview
Pawsitive ID is a web application designed to estimate the breed of a dog based on photos uploaded by the user. Aimed at dog owners, adoption agencies, and veterinarians, Pawsitive ID uses machine learning to approximate the breed makeup of a dog based on its physical characteristics, providing a quick alternative to slow and expensive genetic tests.
Planned features include the ability for the user to view detailed background on their estimated breeds and create a custom dog profile to track other useful pet data all in one place.
